							As a embedded Scrum Team UX designer, I have a special role to play in working closely with the Product Owner and Lead Developer to define the product experience. <mark>It’s important for UX designer to figure out how I can help Product Owner to answer company’s business problems. I can’t limit myself to follow the UX design process. The most important part is that UXers have to find the best way to answer business problems.</mark> Uxers work with PO to uncover user needs and problems through design research and through other types of qualitative or quantitative research, and through analytics.

				<h4>Understanding the Problem Space</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>
				athenahealth has a 2018 goal of removing cash flow delays to incomplete enrollment. Today, getting clients to sign enrollment application forms is contributing to enrollments being incomplete at go live because there are unnecessary blockers to capturing the correct client signature. If athenahealth has power of attorney, athenahealth’s enrollment Ops team can edit and sign on client's behalf.
				</p>
				<p class="quote">
					Because of functionality limitations athenaNet has, enrollment ops teams are forced to work outside of athenaNet to sign payer application forms.
				<p>
				<p>
					This lack of functionality is highly inefficient; per a time study completed by athenahealth’s enrollment Ops team, it took an average of 2.08 minutes to sign a payer form.

					Paper sketching is different from building an idea ‘properly.’ We know what is required to build something -- so, it can be tempting to build the entire concept. But, paper sketching is about quickly learning and evolving an idea, so it’s better to build just enough to gather feedback of what can or cannot work from tech's point of view and move forward. We sketched several designs to meet user's needs.

				<p class="quote">
					The first proposed design is to have the ability of edit and sign the form simultaneously. However, due to developement limitation, I have to make sure that users edit the form before signing.

After our devs have developed this feature and integrated inside athenaNet, we will release our feature to a small set of target users and evaluate our feature by sending out Standard Feature Perception Instrument Survey. This survey helps us identify whether our developed feature meet our measurements of “Intent to Use”, “Perceived Ease of Use” and “Perceived Usefulness”. We will also analysis our design quality by using heuristic evaluation. Later, if we are confident that this feature is ready for release, we will release it to public.
