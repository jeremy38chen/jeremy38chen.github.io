                In the summer of 2015, over 500 people became severe burn patients within few seconds due to the incident of flammable power explosion happened in the “Color Play Asia” party held in a recreational water park in Taipei, Taiwan. This incident not only made the Taiwanese health-care system face a lot of challenges like never before, but it also raised the public awareness of how difficult it is for the severe burn patients to recover and how much pain, both physically and mentally, they will suffer during the long road of rehabilitation within the nation.

              To conclude, through the conducted research and the critical insights we got back from the experienced severe burn patients, we designed the application with multiple functions to meet their needs and accompany them on the road of recovery. As mentioned above, we know that the patients will still have to suffer from the physical discomfort and mental issue, but we are here offering help. We strive to create a better environment for the recovery of the severe burn patients. Future steps can be improved by having more connections with the related institutions and promoting the application to make more users aware of our application so that we are able to have a larger user base. We hope that every single burn patient can reborn as “Phoenix."
