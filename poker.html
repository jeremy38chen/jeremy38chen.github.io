            Ten Point Half is kind of poker game which is simple and easy for players to have fun. The rule is similar with Black Jack. Every player takes turns to be the dealer. If one is the dealer, the others are the players. Each player has the right to hit cards, and the total sum of the cards will be compared with the dealer at the end of the round. However, if the player got over ten points half, the player is busted, and the dealer wins the game.
