              <p>
              For research phases, we know that a burn injury can be a traumatic experience, with tremendous social, physical, and psychological consequences. Many may also suffer from delirium, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suffer from the loss of their normal appearance.
              </p>
              <p class="hightlight">
                “  Stress disorders, including PTSD, are reported to occur after burn injuries in 18%–33% of cases.  It is reported that anxiety is the common aftermath of physical and emotional trauma. ”

              <p>
                After having some background knowledge, we framed our main research question:
              </p>
              <p class="problem">
                How can we help burn patients recover their stress disorders through rebuilding their confidence?
              </p>
              <p>
                Since stress disorder often happens at 2nd or 3rd degree burns, our target users are burn patients who suffer 2nd or 3rd degree burns.
              </p>
              <h2 id="2.3">Semi-structured Interview</h2>
              <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven burn patients. We asked our participants a number of questions regarding their personal burn rehabilitation, and those questions are divided into three timeline, which are timeline before, during and after burning. Main questions include:</p>
              <div class="interview">
                <p>• What are the differences before and after burn injuries?</p>
                <p>• When talking about burn rehabilitation, what are the most difficulties for you?</p>
                <p>• How do you overcome physical and psychological complications?</p>

                We then moved on to ideation, first translating our insights from research onto sticky notes and grouping them based on affinity. The resulting topics helped us understand which features would be important to include in our design. Later, everyone came up with several ideas and solutions. At the end, we discussed the strengthen and weakness of those ideas and refined those ideas to our design.

                Before patients enter Home page, this application requests them to sign-up with their Medical Record Number. This allows only the burn patients to access. Few advantages of this design are 1) Users will not be disturbed by none burn patients. 2) After signing in, patients can directly access their own comprehensive Medical Records through this application 3) Patients can make an appointment directly on this app 4) Patients can consult attending physicians for further instructions or suggestions on physical and mental treatment.

                We created a prototype using Adobe XD to visualize the app transitions and have a published model that could be tested with users before development.

To conclude, through the conducted research and the critical insights we got back from the experienced severe burn patients, we designed the application with multiple functions to meet their needs and accompany them on the road of recovery. We know that the patients will still have to suffer from the physical discomfort and mental issue, but we are here offering help. We strive to create a better environment for the recovery of the severe burn patients. Future steps can be improved by having more connections with the related institutions and promoting the application to make more users aware of our application so that we are able to have a larger user base. We hope that every single burn patient can reborn as “Phoenix."              </p>
              <!--<h2>Future works</h2>
              <p>Evaluation process is needed to validate our design insight.</p>
              <p>Conducting user interview will be useful for better understanding the whole experience customer has in the future.</p>
              <p>Card sorting can be included in research process to validate information structure.</p>
