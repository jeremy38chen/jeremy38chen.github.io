              Tea sensor caught our team on eye while looking for the concept of creating a beneficial, revolutionary, and useful human device. There are three main reasons which initiate teachnology to begin the tea sensor project. First of all, identifying the exact concentration level while brewing tea can be hard to measure, sensor should be created to assist users of aware over-brewing in the fast-pace and busy life. Secondly, customers always desire the highest quality of taste including drinking a cup of tea. Leftover tea can be harmful to one’s health. At last, the durability of the newly invented device is guaranteed. After several key points are concerned, teachology produces this innovative product. In addition, teachnology designed Its app, an application connected to Intelligent Tea Sensor, which provides the function of saving and sharing the tastes. By sharing tea recipe, people will be able to creating their own community and build up their preferable social network.

Then, we start to use affinity diagram to organize our idea and conclude the research result with journey mapping and pain point the users have. From the research we got, we knew some proir points which customers care.

                The first draft of Intelligent Tea Sensor is  like a bottle. We figure out that the best way to deal with being portable and having a high quality of tea everywhere is to design a device combining those points together. A bottle can do everything. It is easy to take. Moreover, it is a container which users do not need to find another container to fill in the water to brewing tea.
                 Nonetheless, <b>A bottle design is not flexible.</b> If the customers want to brewing tea at a cup, this design can not meet the need. This design is also lacking of be creative and innovative.

                Second design we have is a lid design. This design settles the problem of different container. Users can use diversity of container to brewing tea. In addition, it is portable too. The lid design seems suitable in many ways.
                However, <b>it is hard to determine the circumference of the cup.</b> If we can not determine the circumference of the cup, Intelligent Tea Sensor is unstable when user is brewing the tea.

                Therefore, in order to conquer those design issues from the past design, we created this final design, spoon design. This design changes the way we think about brewing tea and meet all the demands which customers need.
                <b>The design is easy to carry and unlimited to every container.</b> A flashing light indicates what Intelligent Tea Sensor is doing now. A button on the front gives user an easy way to save their taste. Furthermore, instead of traditional tea bag, tea leaf can be included into the design. The customers first fill some tea leaf into the bottom of the Intelligent Tea Sensor, and next put Intelligent Tea Sensor into the hot water. When the green flashing light is sparking, it is ready to drink. Several steps turn every user into a tea expert.

              To give the core purpose for customers, teachnology utilized the techniques of TDS, Total Dissolved Solids, and temperature detection to provide accuracy for customers when saving taste and brewing tea. I am going to give further explanations of engineering technique in three part, theory, hardware and software.

            <h4>Theory</h4>
            <div class="grid_12">
              <p>TDS, Total Dissolved Solids, is a method used to define tea concentration. In order to measure the tea ingredients in the solution. TDS is the proper way to determine the concentration of the solution whether it is the customer ’s preference or not. In reality, we knew that TDS can provide a solution for our goal is due to the theory of water TDS probe. This theory utilize the conductivity of the material in the water to measure what the concentration of this solution is. Therefore, we base on this theory to make further expansion for our tea sensor probe.
                It seems like TDS and conductivity have a close relationship, however, it actually aren’t the same thing. TDS is a method to measure the materials in the solution. In fact, it’s to weight the residue in the water after the water has evaporated. It has to be done and observed in the lab. And how is it related to conductivity? There is no exact relationship between conductivity as µS/cm and TDS as ppm. Nonetheless, We can estimate TDS levels based on the conductivity of the water since the hydrogen and oxygen molecules of the H2O carry almost no electrical charge. It has been discovered experimentally that for particular types of water there is an approximate relationship. Taking NACL in the water as a example, to get the ppm of the water with a higher proportion of sodium chloride. We multiply the µS/cm reading by 0.5.

                  The figure above is a simulation of NACL in water in DC current .
                  From the figure, we can see that the molecular separate into different part. It is because of the DC current which breaks the force between molecular. Therefore, we have to avoid this situation, otherwise, the measurement won’t be accurate. AC current is the alternative way to fix this problem.

                   The figure above shows that when we make use of AC current for our measurement. The molecular won’t break apart. If the frequency of AC current is high enough, molecular don’t have enough time to break apart before the opposite current is pulling them. They will look like shaking on their own position.

                After I explained the basic knowledge of TDS, I am going to give a explanation of another core knowledge of TDS. The measurement of TDS is various when the temperature is increasing. It is a huge issue because when brewing tea, the temperature of the tea is increasing or decreasing. If we have to measure the TDS of the tea precisely, we need to deal with this temperature issue.

                Five color curves in the figure above represent separate consentration of tea. The x-axis presents the temperature. The y-axis presents the measurement of TDS. The figure shows that when the temperature is growing, the measurement of TDS is increasing, too. Therefore, How do we solve this problem? The answer is temperature compensation. Temperature compensation is a technique which determine the measurement of TDS correctly when temperature is increasing. If we take look at the figure again, we can realize that the slope of the consentration of tea is increasing gradually. The known data in the figure gives a prediction of slope of every consentration through calculation of interpolation method. Combining the technique of TDS and temperature compensation gives a method to determine the taste accurately.

For exterior design, we start to create the appearance of Intelligent Tea Sensor with 3D printing. We create a model through Rhino, a design software for 3D printing.

               It takes about one years from designing to launching. The product we made right now is actually a prototype for our real product. However, due to the prototype we made, we gather some useful feedback from users. In the future, we are going to make good use of those feedback to create a well-designed Intelligent Tea Sensor which provides users a more usable and efficient design.
            </p>
            <p>To increase popularity of Intelligent Tea Sensor, we exhibit our Intelligent Tea Sensor at New Taipei Mini Maker Faire, which is an exhibition for startup to market their products. In addition, we appreciate techbang, a Chinese blog, for reporting our product.
