            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              In last September, HAAM, which stands for Health Alliance for Austin Musicians, launched a new website and trained their members to use the website. <span>However, still a lot of members and new members need consultation of knowing what kind of benefits a HAAM member has after browsing the website. This causes the problem that HAAM don't have enough staff (reach capacity) to solve all of their questions immediately.</span> HAAM has to improve the usablity of its website to better serve their members.
            </p>
            <h3 id="appear">Solution</h3>
            <p>At the home page, <span>we divide member services into four sections, which are Overview, HAAM’s Core Programs, Insurance 101 and FAQ, based on the result we got from card sorting.</span> Below each section, there is a statement to clarify and convey the important message HAAM wants their member knew. As designer and researcher on the project, I designed all the design mockup, wrote research plan and conduct research as a team.</p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
             As a UX designer, I planned and defined the scope and strategy of this project. <span>I worked collaboratively with my team on research, synthesizing and ideation, and worked individually on wireframing and prototyping. </span>From this project, I have learned how to create and design meaningful information architecture by conducting content audit and open card sorting, and to analyze design quality through heuristic evaluation.

              <p>
                During the client kickoff we had with HAAM, HAAM brought up some important problems they wanted to solve. Within those difficulties, HAAM core programs and insurance were the top issues. <span  class="bold">After launched a new website, HAAM members still had a lot of problem related to member benefits. HAAM expects we can identify usbility issues and improve the website to reduce the number of times HAAM members contact HAAM directly.</span> Currently, there are some common challenges HAAM members have. We summarize some pain points that show us the insights for our future research and redesign:
              </p>
              <div class="pain">
                <p>
                  1. Except for HAAM Core Programs (dental, vision, hearing, wellness, Hep C), members can not have subsidization for other insurance plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. New members misunderstand that HAAM does not provide insurance plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. HAAM can only help members for insurance enrollment for plans with the ACA. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. People encounter problems like missing open enrollment, not paying the premium, not knowing how to locate their member card, not having a way to estimate their income.

                    After accumulation, the severity rating is displayed below. When we are doing heuristic evaluation, most of the problems are related to consistency and standard. The subtitles are not the same, and the information is hard for users to understand and memorize. We suggest the client tackle issues with learnable first.

              <p>
                We conducted a content audit of the member benefits section of the HAAM website. A content audit is a detailed listing of all the content on a site, and is a necessary step of any website redesign. It is a useful tool for keeping track of the content and making sure it’s all present in the redesign, as well as for gaining a better understanding of the content and its inner relationships.

                We ran a card sorting study to help us decide how to reorganize the site. We chose an open card sort where participants organized cards into groups that made sense to them and then labeled those groups.

                  <p>
                    We created our study online using OptimalSort. Our 30 cards included much of the content from the content audit, as well as additional information we deemed to be necessary based on information from the client kick-off and our prior evaluations of the site. Most of the additional content was about the Affordable Care Act and health insurance in general.

                    Based on the simialrity matrix, we can know how people group the content. There are three main areas that participants grouped together, which are benefits-related information, membership-related information and insurance-related information.

              <p>
                We have made strides in better presenting HAAM benefits by allowing users of the site improved navigation and structure to find the information they need. Future work to continue to develop a comprehensive site include:
              </p>
              <div class="sub">
                <p>● Focusing on the enrollment process, both for HAAM & ACA</p>
                <p>● Providing more information regarding health insurance literacy</p>
                <p>● Providing more information about local health insurance options</p>
              </div>

              <p>The overall site simply splits into two sections: I am a Member and Become a Member. This labeling is confusing for someone who just wants to know what benefits HAAM offers, and the overall site layout can be adjusted accordingly. We also recommend adding content to the Insurance 101 section in order to help HAAM members feel even more empowered and in control of their health needs. Additionally, more information about available local health plans could be of use to potential members. Finally, this redesign along with future prototypes and research ought to be completed with actual local musicians, both young and old, in order to ensure the website best caters to its actual audience.</p>
