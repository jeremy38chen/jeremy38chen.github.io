              <p>
                The challenges for this hackathon is to provide a reasonable solution to solve the problem the company has. To come up with a rational solution, we have to structure the time schedule to meet the deadline. It is hard to conduct good UX research and turn those into useful insights within 24 hour. However, by following the process of design sprint, we set short-term and long-term goals of this project, and generate practical idea and turn those insights to real action.

              <p>
                From our research, we learned that people are willing to pay more for healthier foods, including those that are GMO-free, have no artificial coloring/flavors and are deemed all natural.
              </p>
              <p class="hightlight">
                “  Employees who eat healthy all day long were 25 percent more likely to have higher job performance. ”

              <p>
                Targeting customers trying to eat healthy, we framed our main research question:
              </p>
              <p class="problem">
                How can we help Three Square Market to provide wide range of food that are healthy and beneficial for customers?

              <p>
                Since micro market concept brings convenient meal and snack options to the workplace, the employees are our targeted users.

                By competitive Analysis, it helps us  find out how other people solved the same design problems and explore approaches to solving similar problems.

                    After doing a competitive analysis of micro market, we knew that many company currently define healthy as providing fresh food for customers. We want to narrow our focus on providing multi-choice and healthy food for users. The definition of healthy food means not only fresh but also beneficial to customers.

              <p>
                  Journey Mapping is told from the customer’s perspective, but also emphasizes the important intersections between user expectations and business requirements. Through Journey Mapping, it helps us understand the whole experience that the customers have when interacting with micro market.

                  Pain Point 2

                <span>
                  The information of discount is not clear enough on mobile or in store.

                We then moved on to ideation, first translating our insights from research onto sticky notes and grouping them based on affinity. The resulting topics helped us understand which features would be important to include in our design. We used this to inform our storyboards.

                We landed on a concept that came out of insights from our research: Because of limitation of time, employee often goes to micro market to grab some heathy food. However, they struggle with understanding which food is heathy. Moreover, when applying coupon on their order, the information is too complicated. The following storyboard outlines our initial concept.
